                <p>In one of <strong>Escher’s</strong> most beloved, most copied, and most parodied images, a series of staircases crisscross in a labyrinth-like interior. At first, the staircases seem to occupy a believable illusionistic space, but upon closer inspection viewers realize that they meet each other at impossible angles. In fact, the shape defined by the three main staircases is a famous <em>“impossible shape”</em> called a Penrose triangle.</p>

                <p>The two faces, created from one piece of ribbon, ultimately complete each other, the fractured appearance, almost like orange peel, yet the two faces are complete. They are disjointed from a physical body, giving the impression of the connect going far deeper than the physical, and the relationship between the two transcends the environment around them.</p>

                <p> metamorphosis is a change in appearance. The most famous example is a caterpillar that transforms into a butterfly. In 1937, <em>Escher created his first Metamorphosis</em>. In it, he depicts the transition of the small town of Atrani via geometrically rigid patterns into a freestanding figure. This woodcut is only a “try-out”, compared to how Escher subsequently fleshed out the theme.</p>
